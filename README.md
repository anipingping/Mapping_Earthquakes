# Mapping_Earthquakes
Inside the Earthquake_Challenge folder you will find index.html and the folder static with 2 subfolders, css and js. css contains the style.css file. js contains challenge_logic.js and config.js.

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository contains a map with data on faultlines around the world, all earthquakes worldwide that occurred in the last 7 days, and a map layer displaying major earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater. Anyone who runs index.html will be able to toggle the map between a street view, night view, and satellite view.
